This document is a list of what to do to get up and running after hd format and os reinstall:

1. Ruby and Homebrew:
	Install RVM:
		\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

	If needed, install gem:
		https://rubygems.org/pages/download
	Run the brewinstaller.sh shell, which installs homebrew and some other stuff, then go to step 2. 

	Alternatively, do this manually:
	Install Homebrew:
		ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"	
		setup homebrew for bulk install: 
		brew tap caskroom/cask
		brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
	
	Installed packages: 
		rcm
		git
		boxes
		cabal-install
		apple-gcc42
		openssl (might want to avoid this -- heartbleed bug)
		tidy
		sqllite

		Install Rcm
			brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
			brew install rcm
		If haven't done already: Grab the dotfiles repo from git: 
		git clone https://github.com/trcook/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles


2. Applications: 
	From App Store:
		codebox
		displaymenu
		marked
	Run brewinstaller.sh to install homebrew and some homebrew packages.
	Run caskinstaller.sh to install a bunch of apps:
	 -- make sure environment vars are set properly. they are specified in .bash_profile
		alfred
		dash
		rstudio
		dropbox
		sourcetree
		iterm2

3. configuring
	- generate new ssh keys.
	run 'mkdir ~/.ssh' to make a home for ssh keys
	go to bluehost and follow instructions for ssh key generation and installation
	go https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/ to read how to generate github keys.

	- Make sure casks are setup properly -- see env.vars setup in bash.profile.

	- install mactex and install custom latex files:
			mkdir ~/Library/texmf
			cd ~/Library/texmf
			git pull https://github.com/trcook/my_latex_templates.git

	- install oh my zsh:
			curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh


4. Some odds and ends

	- reinstall npm via brewinstaller.sh or: brew install npm
	- use npm to install some things: 
		- npm-install grunt -g
